# Moon-Rover

Code for the Imperial College London moon rover project.

## Note on project version

The current main branch of the project was created between the time of report submission and the live demonstration. This version uses a fixed 61kHz radio, an IR sensor, and a Hall effect (magnetic) sensor. This was done because there were issues with adjusting the frequency of the radio (low selectivity), so this set of sensors was used to differentiate between minerals 1/2 and 3/4 better.
